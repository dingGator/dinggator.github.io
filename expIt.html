          The tour was wonderful.  The guide started with an overview of the sinkhole and the uplands surrounding the sinkhole.<br>  He pointed out the spruce pines and the chestnut oaks in the uplands.  There were orchids, and needle palms.  Longleaf pines were seen everywhere in the uplands.<br>
            As he guided us down the boardwalk, he pointed out the different features of the sink hole.  The Indian hunted around the creeks of the sinkhole because the deer came to drink the water from the streams.  Lush ferns painted the cavity wall with a lush green, and feeding off the water of the creeks.  Needle palms and orchids were scattered with the ferns giving a beautiful wall to the sink hole.<br>
            He explained how the sinkhole was formed.  The rainwater became slightly acidic as it seeps thru the dead plants layers on the ground.  The slightly acidic water then dissolved the underlying limestone bedrock forming a huge cavern.  Eventually when there not enough limestone to support the weight of the land above the ceiling of the limestone collapsed forming the sinkhole.<br>
            Then he told the legends of the name of the sinkhole, Devils Millhopper.<br><br>
